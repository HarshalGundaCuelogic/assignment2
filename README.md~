Steps for the assignment:

1.	Run 'fileserver.sh' in the root folder using command as 'sh fileserver.sh'.

2.	It will create the network as 'mynetwork1' with the subnet as '172.168.11.40/29'.

3.	It will create the volume for server as 'servervol'.

3.	It will automatically build the image named as 'serverimage:1.0' using Dockerfile placed in the folder named as 'server' which will create a file of size 		1KB automatically in the container.

4.	In the Dockerfile, I have used a base image 'alpine:latest' and then installed the packages/apks for the communication.

5.	Also, I have created a user in it and set a password to it.

6.	Now, I am running the server container named as 'ServerContainer' in the background using detached mode.

7.	This script will run the 'fileclient.sh' file automatically.

8.	Here, I am created a volume for client mnamed as 'clientvol'.

9.	It will also automatically build the image named as 'clientimage:1.0' using Dockerfile placed in the folder named as 'client'.

10.	I have used the same base image 'alpine:latest' in the Dockerfile and installed the required packages/apks for the communication with other container.

11.	Now, it will run the client container named as 'ClientContainer' in the interactive mode.
